                    <p>
                        Hanna Myers fell in love with dogs at the age of eight. When her father took her to a search-and-rescue demonstration in Olympia. The founder of the group, Edith Goldman decided that day to use Hanna as a decoy for one of the dogs.she has been hooked ever since.
                        Over the past 21 years Hanna has worked hard to improve her knowledge of Canine behavior. She studied animal behavior and animal psychology at TCC. Attended numerous seminars and conferences. She is a member of assistance dogs international, a club leader for Therapy dogs international, a recognized AKC evaluator, trick dog evaluator and a certified Veterans center support team member.
                        It has been a life long passion to bring dogs and humans together through clear communication and understanding.
                        10 years ago, Hanna founded Elite K9. It has grown to become one of the most well known names in Washington.
                        In 2018 she founded Canine kinship. A non profit service dog program. That trains service dogs for those with disabilities free of charge.
                        There isn't a dog sport that Hanna hasn't done or knows everything about. She has dedicated her life to these amazing animals.
